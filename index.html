	<h2>Athletics</h2> 
	 <p>
	 I play football and I also wrestle for Damien High School. My main sport is football, and I have been playing it since I was 6 years old. I was starting middle linebacker this year for the Varsity football team. I also wrestled freshamn year, but decided to quit to focus on football.

	<h2>Academics</h2> 
	 <p> 
	 I attend Damien High School in La Verne, California. I have attended Damien all four years and I would say my favorite subject is English. I enjoy all the friends I have made at Damien, and I have loved every teacher I have had here!

	<h2>Music</h2> 
	 <p> 
	 I love listening to music. For me, music is an outlet from my daily grind. I enjoy putting on Tyler the Creator while I work on my homework. For me, music helps me focus on what I need to, and forget about the outside world.
